## react-movie-app

    This a simple React movie app that provides information about a movie/series using The Movie DB API. The aim is to demonstrate my understanding of React's fundamentals and also put on display my design skills as underlined in the coding assessment file. The reason why I chose The Movie DB api form the free Github APIs is because it is very well documented and provides a lot of features that can utilize should I want to enhance my project. According to my research, the API is very reliable and very faster allowing for a good user experience.

    Had I had more time, I would have liked to implement the React Skeleton for a more advanced UI design just incase the api is slow when fetching data. The app overall can be improved in a variety of ways overtime. For example, I could implement login/logout functionality etc. Caching would have been something I would also have implemented to allow for a personalized experience when a user logs in. another section I could not build due to time constraints was a "Coming Soon" section where users can view the release date of a movie/series, cast information and the movie's or series's trailer. With more time I am certain I would have come up with a lot more ideas to improve the app whilst also taking advantage of the API's full features which i would have needed more time to explore.

    Please note, I was hard pressed for time due to other commitments hence I was unable top implement the Bonus points tasks. However, hope the code demonstrates my understanding of React fundamentals.

## PROJECT NAVIGATION

    Click on a movie card to go to the movie/series page where you can view the cast and plot information and then scroll down to view the trailer.

    Click on the Navbar links to navigate to the movies section or the series section where you have the option search for either a movie or series depending on which tab you are on. Please not, when on the Movies section you can only search for movies and the same applies for the TV series section.

## PROJECT SETUP

    1. Download the Zip folder from the provided github repo.

    2. Unzip the project folder & Delete the package-lock.json file.

    3. Run `npm install` or 'yarn install'.

### `Avoid mixing yarn and npm as that can lead to Dependency conflicts among other issues.`

    4. Launch the project using either `yarn start` or `npm start` depending on which package manager between the 2 you have chosen.

### `Happy Hacking!`

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start` or `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test` or `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build` or `yarn run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject` or `yarn run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
